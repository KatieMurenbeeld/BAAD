# BAAD
Repo for analysis of Biomass and Allometry Database (BAAD). 

## R Studio
R package for BAAD: https://github.com/dfalster/baad. Install instructions: https://github.com/traitecoevo/baad.data

## Jupyter Notebook
I made an earlier attempt in the Fall of 2019 with python to calculate the best fit parameters for the FATES allometric functions (see https://fates-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fates_tech_note.html#allometry-and-growth-along-allometric-curves). That notebook with minor revisions as well as the BAAD subset for ponderosa pine (baad_pipo.csv) have been uploaded to this repo. Please note that one would need to update the data directories to properly link to ponderosa pine data.
